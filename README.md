ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mumtaz. <br>

Thank you for stopping by my github profile. <br>

I love learning new programming techniques one project at a time. Here you will find my website portfolio, a small todo app, a modified version of Wordle, and more. <br>

I personally ponder on two questions and center my projects around its answers - what do I truly enjoy learning and what was the first time I felt passionate towards what I was about to learn? 
<br> If you'd like to share your answers to these questions, reach out to me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mumtazf/"> LinkedIn </a> and I'll love to learn more about you!
