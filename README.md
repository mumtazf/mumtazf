ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mumtaz. <br>

Thank you for stopping by my github profile. <br>

I love learning new programming techniques one project at a time. Here you will find my website portfolio, a small todo app, a modified version of Wordle, and more. <br>
As you view my profile, I'd like you to ponder on the question - what do you truly enjoy learning and did you dedicate enough time pursuing that interest?
