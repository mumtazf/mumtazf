ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mumtaz Fatima. <br>

I love learning new programming techniques one project at a time. Here you will find my website portfolio, my habit buddies app, a nature-inspired version of Wordle, and more. <br>

Before starting any project, I typically ponder on two questions and then center my projects around its answers - what do I truly enjoy learning and how do my interests intersect with leaving a positive impact on society?
<br> If you'd like to share your answers to these questions, reach out to me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mumtazf/"> LinkedIn </a> and I'll love to learn more about you!
